# How to Host Your Website for Free

Here are the two simplest ways to host your Nova Development website for free.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest & Fastest)
*Best for getting it online in 30 seconds.*

1.  Go to **[app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)** in your browser.
2.  Locate your **`NOVA OFFICIAL`** folder on your Desktop.
3.  **Drag and drop** the entire folder onto the highlighted area on the Netlify website.
4.  Wait a few seconds for it to upload.
5.  **Done!** Netlify will give you a random URL (like `brave-curie-123456.netlify.app`).
6.  *Optional*: Click "Site settings" > "Change site name" to customize your URL (e.g., `nova-developments.netlify.app`).

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Best for Long Term)
*Best if you want to make frequent updates and have a professional setup.*

1.  **Create a Repository**:
    *   Log in to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/).
    *   Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
    *   Name it (e.g., `nova-official`).
    *   Make sure it is **Public**.
    *   Click **Create repository**.

2.  **Upload Your Files**:
    *   On the new repository page, click the link that says **uploading an existing file**.
    *   Drag and drop all your files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, etc.) from your folder into the browser.
    *   Click **Commit changes**.

3.  **Activate Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   On the left sidebar, click **Pages**.
    *   Under "Build and deployment" > "Branch", select **main** (or *master*) from the dropdown.
    *   Click **Save**.

4.  **View Site**:
    *   Wait about 1-2 minutes.
    *   Refresh the page. You will see your live URL at the top (e.g., `yourusername.github.io/nova-official`).
